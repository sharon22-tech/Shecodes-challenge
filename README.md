# Assignment Title: Hands-on Exercise: Front-End Form Data Handling with JavaScript

## Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to provide students with practical experience in handling form data on the front-end using JavaScript. Students will learn how to capture, manipulate, validate, and display form data without relying on server-side processing.

## Assignment Overview:
In this hands-on exercise, students will create a web form and use JavaScript to handle the data submitted by users. The form data will be captured, validated, and displayed dynamically on the same page or in another section of the webpage. The assignment will focus on the concepts of data handling, including reading form inputs, processing data, and updating the UI based on user interactions.

## Requirements:

### JavaScript Data Handling:

Data Capture: Write JavaScript to capture data from all form fields when the form is submitted.

### Data Validation:
Ensure all required fields are filled out.
Validate the email format.
Check if the user has selected a preferred contact method.
If the "I accept terms and conditions" checkbox is checked, display a confirmation message.

### Data Processing:
Store the form data in an object for easy access.

### Display:
Dynamically display the captured form data in a designated section of the webpage (e.g., a "Form Summary" section) after the form is submitted.
Update the displayed data in real-time as the user makes changes to the form.

### Interactivity:

Provide real-time feedback to the user as they fill out the form (e.g., display a message if the email format is incorrect).
Use event listeners to handle form submissions and data changes.
Display a confirmation message when the form is successfully submitted.
